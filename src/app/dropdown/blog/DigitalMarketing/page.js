//                         <p>The reason? While spending on paid media increased to 27.9% of the budget in 2024, investments in martech, labor, and agencies declined, with technology spending hitting its lowest point in a decade.</p>
//                         <p>In fact, according to our CMOs report Challenges, Budgets, Digital Transformation, & Skills, 20% of senior marketers identify maximizing ROI on their marketing budget as their biggest challenge.</p>
//                         <p>Another factor that could impact budgets is AI. As more marketing platforms integrate AI and its tools become increasingly accessible, many marketing leaders see the technology as a valuable resource during times of financial constraint.</p>
//                         <p>“To optimize budgets in the age of AI, marketers must adopt a precision mindset. They need to invest in AI tools that automate repetitive tasks, use predictive analytics to forecast campaign performance, and allocate resources based on real-time data insights,” advises Mischa McInerney, CMO at the Digital Marketing Institute. “Effective planning means testing, learning, and iterating quickly—prioritizing channels and strategies that show proven ROI while reducing spend on underperforming areas.” </p>

//                         <p>This requires evaluating past marketing performance and analyzing data to identify the most effective channels.

//                         <p>Now, let’s explore five essential steps to creating a strong and practical marketing budget.</p>

//                         <p>One of the most crucial first steps in setting a digital marketing budget is establishing clear, well-defined goals. A scattered approach—trying everything and hoping for the best—will only lead to wasted time and resources.</p>
//                         <p>Instead, focus on identifying the specific outcomes you want to achieve. This could be a singular objective or a primary goal supported by secondary and tertiary targets.</p>
//                         <p>No matter the approach, having a clear vision is essential. Your goals might include:</p>
//                         <ul className="flex flex-col gap-5">
//                             <li className="flex items-center">

//                             </li>

//                         <h3 className="text-[36px] text-[#585858] font-[700]">2. Evaluate Past Performance</h3>
//                         <p>The most effective way to allocate your budget wisely is by analyzing past performance. This involves assessing key factors such as marketing channels, attribution (how different tactics contributed to sales, conversions, or other objectives), paid media, and overall campaign effectiveness.</p>
//                         <p>To do this successfully, you must review essential efficiency metrics that reveal which investments are delivering both short-term gains and long-term sustainable growth.</p>

//                         <h3 className="text-[36px] text-[#585858] font-[700]">3. Allocate Budget Based on Success</h3>
//                         <p>Once you’ve established your goals and assessed what’s working, you can begin structuring your budget based on priorities and proven success.</p>
//                         <p>
//                             The key focus should be success, not just cost. By analyzing past performance and key metrics, you can determine which paid, earned, and owned media strategies have delivered the best results.
//                             For instance, social media marketing may require little to no budget if you rely solely on organic content. However, if your past data shows that Instagram effectively boosts brand awareness, it may be worth allocating funds toward paid ads or influencer collaborations.</p>
//                         <p>Think about it this way—if Instagram is already driving results with minimal effort, imagine its potential with a dedicated social media manager or the right tools and software.</p>
//                         <p>A survey by Neil Patel Digital on 2025 marketing budgets revealed shifting trends in social ad spending. Interestingly, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter) are seeing the highest budget increases at 49% and 55%, respectively, while Facebook's budget growth is expected to be just 14%.</p>

//                         <h3 className="text-[36px] text-[#585858] font-[700]">4. Breakdown Your Requirements</h3>
//                         <p>Now that you have a clear understanding of your goals and the strategies and channels needed to achieve them, it’s time to allocate your budget to the necessary resources.</p>
//                         <p>Digital marketing primarily relies on two key components: tools/software and human resources. Your budget should account for both.</p>
//                         <p>For example, consider your approach to paid advertising. Do you want to invest in well-established methods like pay-per-click (PPC) advertising? According to HubSpot’s Annual State of Marketing Report, 63% of people have clicked on a Google ad, highlighting its potential. Or, given the success of your organic social efforts, would it be worthwhile to explore paid social ads?</p>
//                         <p>Additionally, think about the personnel required to manage paid campaigns. Do you need a dedicated specialist for each platform, or will a single team member oversee all paid marketing efforts? If it’s the latter, how much time should they allocate to it, and what tools will they need to maximize efficiency?</p>

//                         <h3 className="text-[36px] text-[#585858] font-[700]">5. Plan Your Content Marketing</h3>
//                         <p>Marketers rely on content to attract, engage, and convert customers, making content ideation and creation a crucial part of any strategy. This process should be driven by a well-structured content marketing plan to ensure consistency, relevance, and effectiveness.</p>
//                         <div className="relative mx-auto w-[50%] m-3 h-[600px]">
//                             <Image
//                                 src="/blog-5.png"
//                                 alt="Image"
//                                 layout="fill"
//                                 objectFit="cover"
//                                 className="w-full h-full transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-105"
//                             />
//                         </div>
//                         <p>The type of content you create depends heavily on your business model, audience, and goals.
//                             For service-based businesses, long-form content such as case studies, whitepapers, and in-depth blogs can help educate potential clients and establish industry authority. This may require budgeting for expert writers or implementing a guest blogging strategy to ensure high-quality content.</p>
//                         <p>On the other hand, product-based businesses often see better results with video content, especially for social media. Since video production requires a different skill set, your budget may need to cover recording and editing equipment, hiring presenters or writers, and other production costs. Infographics, listicle-style blogs, and content tailored to each stage of the sales funnel can also be valuable in this case.</p>
//                         <p>Remember just because you’re a service-based company doesn’t mean you can’t use short-form video or TikTok. Here’s a great video from Shopify aimed at its users in anticipation of Black Friday.</p>

By analyzing past performance and key metrics, you can determine which paid, earned, and owned media strategies have delivered the best results.For instance, social media marketing may require little to no budget if you rely solely on organic content.

According to HubSpot’s Annual State of Marketing Report, 63% of people have clicked on a Google ad, highlighting its potential. Or, given the success of your organic social efforts, would it be worthwhile to explore paid social ads?"} />

Since video production requires a different skill set, your budget may need to cover recording and editing equipment, hiring presenters or writers, and other production costs. Infographics, listicle-style blogs, and content tailored to each stage of the sales funnel can also be valuable in this case."} />
